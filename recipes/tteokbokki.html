    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>(From Wikipedia) Tteokbokki (떡볶이), or simmered rice cake, is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon (떡면; "rice cake noodles") or commonly tteokbokki-tteok (떡볶이 떡; "tteokbokki rice cakes"). Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former is the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki).</p>

    <em>The following recipe is taken from My Korean Kitchen</em>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Main</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g / 12 ounces Korean rice cakes, separated</li>
        <li>150g / 5.3 ounces Korean fish cakes, rinsed over hot water & cut into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups Korean soup stock (dried kelp and dried anchovy stock), use this recipe</li>
        <li>60g / 2 ounces onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tteokbokki Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp roasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 stalk green onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Unless your rice cakes are soft already, soak them in warm water for 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high heat and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it with a spatula. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes and onion. Boil them a further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully cooked.  Then, to thicken the sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low heat for a further 2 to 4 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
